+ Bug fixing
  - Wrong "Uptime since" value in web form and config menu
  - Boot with Battery -> Go to sleep -> Plug USB -> Timer Wakeup and WebServer doesn't re-init
+ Added SPIFFSErrors variable for Error statistics. It is sent to Cloud and shown in web page as well.

    if Battery is the power source. This makes the power detection faster and it avoids
    going to sleep when USB is unplugged and plugged back again 6 sec. later.
