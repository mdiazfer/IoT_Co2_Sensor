To do list
-----------
- Web server to display results and configuration
  + Enable WiFi ON/OFF and webServer ON/OFF in the web menu (?)
    * Pop-up if disable WiFi or Web Server to warn about
  + fix web pages layout for smartphone
  + https
  + Firmware upgrade OTA
- Troubleshoot
  + Device goes to sleep when starting from battery and doesn't go to usbState when USB plugged
  + Device wake up becasue USB power, but webServer doen't work
  + WebServer doesn't begin randomly (after firmware upload???)
  + WiFi connection failures
  + No button action after waking up with button
  + After battery is ran out, pluging USB power doesn't take effect in the IoT
- BLE sutff
- Get info about bluetooth to update icons
- Icon for the bootup screen
- Candidate features
  + REST API to get results
  + Triger alarms
  + Save CO2 samples in cloud to not lose graph pictures when the battery runs out
  + Adding Bootup info Option to the Display Info Menu


Done
-------
+ Config Menu for simple things: WiFi ON/OFF, SampleUpload ON/OFF, BLE ON/OFF
  + uploadSamplesEnabled should be linked to wifiEnabled in the Config Menu
  + change error_setup values to be mask-oriented and re-code the firstSetup for OR-error_setup and
     warmingUp() to detec dead errors and take actions
  + Bug fixing: WiFi icon for wifi0Status
  + Write in EEPROM the config variables: wifiEnabled,bluetoothEnabled,uploadSamplesEnabled,energyCurrentMode
+ Bug fixing: Button1 presses in firstBoot goest to hibernate regardless how long it was pressed
+ Changes so that WIFI connection, NTP Sync and httpRequest functions don't block neither Button nor Display Refresh
+ Check scaling last_hour buffer works when changing the sample period (changing saving energy mode) 
+ Check NTP_KO_CHECK_PERIOD works after code modification
+ Fix NTP KO message in boot screen
+ change nowTimeGlobal=lastNowTimeGlobal+… by nowTimeGlobal=nowTimeGlobal+…and delete lastNowTimeGlobal
+ Bug fixing (v0.9.1)
  + Timer updates when power changes
+ Update icons during Warmup screen (v0.9.1)
+ Switch off mode (v0.9.1)
+ Avoid getting CO2 sample if Volt<MIN_VOLT (v0.9.1)
+ Setup Time Zone based on TZ environment variable instead of GMT_OFFSET_SEC & DAYLIGHT_OFFSET_SEC (v0.9.0)
  + TZ values based on Cities: https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.csv
  + Example for Madrid Time Zone:
    setenv("TZ","CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3",1); tzset();
    getLocalTime(&startTimeInfo);Serial.println(&startTimeInfo, "%d/%m/%Y - %H:%M:%S");
+ Deep Sleep mode implementation if BAT powered (v0.9.0) 
+ Show real time sample in Info menus (bat vol, ntp, wifi, url) (v0.8.1)
+ Review scale of battery icons (i.e. 97% => shows 75% icon)
+ Recover WiFi connection if lost 
+ Fine tunning actions and periods to reduce energy consumption
  + Increase WiFi Scanning period and avoid scann if Display is OFF
  + Increase sample period
  + Merge Volt check and Battery check
  + Increase Volt check period and avoid scann if Display is OFF
  + Display black screen if the Display is OFF
  + Take samples once the Display is just ON back
+ Battery info in General Info menu
+ Backup NTP Server
+ Backup SSID
+ Temperature calibration
+ Battery monitoring
+ Bug fix:
  + No wifi => error message in Serial; should force no ntp connection and no GET send
+ Bug fixing
  + Show fix samples -> Menu Gral -> Menu info -> Print sometning -> back -> back (v0.7.1)
  + Show Las 24h graph -> Menu Gral -> back doesn't work (v0.7.1)
+ Scroll up/down for the bootup screen v0.7.1)
+ Get info about ntp and web server to update icons (v0.7.1)
+ Get info for: wifi (v0.7.0)
+ Icons (v0.6.9)
+ Added 2-level menu. Menu Global is the top level (v0.6.8)
+ Added NTP to get time synced  (v0.6.8)
+ Added URL to upload periodically samples to external server (v0.6.8)
+ Bug fixing (v0.6.5)
  + Graph not updated in fixed mode display
  + Wrong Temp & Hum line color in graphs
+ Press button to swap between different screens (v0.6.4)
+ Graph picture with the Tº/Hum measurements history (v0.6.3)
+ Graph picture with the CO2 measurements history (v0.6.2)
+ Improvements in the WIFI bootup message (v0.6.1)
+ Make CO2 parameters sensor-model-independant (working with preprocessor macros _CO2_SENSOR_PARAMETER_, _CONCATENATE_ and _STRINGIFY_) (v0.6.1)
+ Change from numercial coordinates to parameters for the items in the TFT (v0.6.1)
+ Change CO2 range to 2000 pppm in MH-Z19B (v0.6)
+ Implement pre-heating time to avoid presenting CO2 measurements when the sensor is being warming (v0.6)
+ CO2 Sensor check-outs at bootup (v0.6)
