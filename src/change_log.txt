- 0.6.7 18/Sep/2022   - Added funcion getHumidityCompensated() to class SHT2x to implement the 
                        temperature coefficient compensation equation to guarantee Relative Humidity accuracy

                        float SHT2x::getHumidityCompensated()
                        {
                          //Implementing temperature coefficient compensation equation to guarantee Relative Humidity accuracy
                          float humidityCompensated = -6.0 + (125.0 / 65536.0) * _rawHumidity;
                          humidityCompensated += -0.15 * (25.0 - (-46.85 + (175.72 / 65536.0) * _rawTemperature));
                          humidityCompensated = (humidityCompensated)<(0.0)?(0.0):((humidityCompensated)>(100.0)?(100.0):(humidityCompensated));
  
                          return humidityCompensated;
                        }

                        must be added on SHT2x.cpp and SHT2x.h in case the SHT2x library is overwritten (clean all, update, etc)
