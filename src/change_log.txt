------- -----------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 0.9.D 17/Mar/2023   - Added Firmware upgrade OTA
                      - Added SPIFFSErrors variable for Error statistics. It is sent to Cloud and shown in web page as well.
                      - Power checks done every VOLTAGE_CHECK_PERIOD seconds while the display is ON, even
                        if Battery is the power source. This makes the power detection faster and it avoids
                        going to sleep when USB is unplugged and plugged back again 6 sec. later.
