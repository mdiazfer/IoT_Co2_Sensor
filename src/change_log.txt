- 0.6.8 21/Sep/2022   - Added version at bootup screen. Color modifications in graphs for better reading
                      - Bug fixing function SHT2x::getHumidityCompensated()
                      - Added 2-level menu. Menu Global is the top level
                      - Added Display Info menu in Menu Global
                      - Added NTP server
                      - Added URL to upload samples to external server
- 0.6.7 18/Sep/2022   - Added funcion getHumidityCompensated() to class SHT2x to implement the 
                        temperature coefficient compensation equation to guarantee Relative Humidity accuracy

                        float SHT2x::getHumidityCompensated()
                        {
                          //Implementing temperature coefficient compensation equation to guarantee Relative Humidity accuracy
                          float humidityCompensated = -6.0 + (125.0 / 65536.0) * _rawHumidity;
                          humidityCompensated += -0.15 * (25.0 - (-46.85 + (175.72 / 65536.0) * _rawTemperature));
                          humidityCompensated = (humidityCompensated)<(0.0)?(0.0):((humidityCompensated)>(100.0)?(100.0):(humidityCompensated));
  
                          return humidityCompensated;
                        }

                        must be added on SHT2x.cpp and SHT2x.h in case the SHT2x library is overwritten (clean all, update, etc)
- 0.6.6 18/Sep/2022   - Added sensor SH7021 for Temp and Humidity
                        + Temp & Humidity samples got from that sensor rather CO2 sensor (better precission)
                      - Improve rounding to 1 decimals the value of valueT when converting into String
- 0.6.5 17/Sep/2022   - Bug fixing
                        + Graph not updated in fixed mode display
                        + Wrong Temp & Hum line color in graphs
- 0.6.4 17/Sep/2022   - Press button to swap between different screens
                      - Libreries TFT_eSPI & EspSoftwareSerial updated
- 0.6.3 16/Sep/2022   - Adding graphs in the main screen for last hour and last day Tem & Hum evolution
- 0.6.2 16/Sep/2022   - Adding graphs in the main screen for last hour and last day CO2 evolution
- 0.6   10/Sep/2022   - Changing CO2 range to 2000 pppm in MH-Z19B
                      - Implementing pre-heating time to avoid presenting CO2 measurements during warming
                      - CO2 Sensor check-outs at bootup
- 0.5   10/Sep/2022   - Initial minimal and working version for sensor MH-Z19B. Shows results in the display
